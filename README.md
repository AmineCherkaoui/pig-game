## Description

Pig is a simple dice game.

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice until either a **1** is rolled or the player decides to **hold**:

## Rules

- The rules are simple. Two players will compete. The first player to reach **100 points** or more is the winner

- If the player rolls a **1**, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
- If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
- If a player chooses to **hold**, their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
